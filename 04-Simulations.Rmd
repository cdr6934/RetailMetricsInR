# Simulations

Being able to take the information that we already know and use it to determine alternative outcomes in an unknown circumstance. But how do we simulate an occurance based upon the data that we have? 


## Monte Carlo 
This recursive algorithm has been around for some time now; but it continues to be the core of many simulatory methodologies. 

## Gaussian Mixed Models (GMM)
The following mixture model takes into consideration...

## Supply Chain 
Here is another example on how to model the costing forecast vs the forecasting that is currently being done.
