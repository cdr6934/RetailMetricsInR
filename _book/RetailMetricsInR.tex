\chapter{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

The following book takes into consideration that you have some
familiarity with R and have had some sort of experience in retail.
However this has been written to be practical; rather than very
theoretical in order for the practicing novice to pick up and complete
their own analysis of retail data.

\end{Shaded}

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter
is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to
install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX):

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\section{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

The following book gives the retail data analyst or scientist the core
skillset in order to be able to pivot.

The disruption of retail continues to speed up creating an environment
that is feared by the largest of companies and tends to be run by a few
at the top (i.e.~Amazon, Walmart). Thus there are a few advantages one
needs to take in this climate. Data and speed.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

There are so many ways to monitor data within a store. Anything from
simple traffic counters, to the complexity of an Amazon Go store. Thus
it is imperitive to start collecting as much data as you can. It is not
in your interest to try to collect some; rather collect more than you
can get. Your future self will be quite thankful.

\hypertarget{speed}{%
\subsection{Speed}\label{speed}}

And as retail becomes more competitive, it is important to quickly pivot
and be able to make change based upon the climate of your users. They
will want you to provide them experiences that are unique and special.
It can make and break them. Thu speed in data also is important. It
needs to be \textbf{accessable} to everyone who can use it; and you will
need to \textbf{talent} to be able to address these analysis quicker
than the rest of them.

\hypertarget{retail-overview}{%
\chapter{Retail Overview}\label{retail-overview}}

Retail metrics\ldots{} I suppose it is something you have to be
passionate to write about. Or really miserable to try to pinpoint the
common methodologies by which one is able to manage a store. However it
is important to understand the way it works in ordeer to be able to give
one's best attention to the work.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Total Gross Sales \(S_G\) / Gross Sales \(S_g\)
\item
  Returns \(S_r\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{total-net-sales}{%
\section{Total Net Sales}\label{total-net-sales}}

\[
S_{NET} = \sum{S_{g}-S_{r}}
\] One of the fundamental metrics to navigate the success and growth of
any organization is the Net Sales. It is the overall amount of Revenue
metric.

\hypertarget{year-over-year-growth}{%
\section{Year over Year Growth}\label{year-over-year-growth}}

\[
S_{YOY} = \frac{S_{net_{TY}}-S_{net_{LY}}}{S_{net_{LY}}}
\] YOY comparision of sales shed light in the growth of the company.
Some of these factors include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Product Mix}: there is alot of science in this, but having the
  right product for your store is extremely important. But having even
  more ``right'' product for your customers will increase their
  frequency to buy. On the flip side, you will see a negative growth if
  your customers do not find the right product. This will eventually
  frustrate them to not return, and its only new customers that will
  bring back more people.
\item
  \textbf{New Customers}: Especially when the store is brand new, it can
  take some time for your customers to find your store. But as the word
  spreads about the store, they find themselves to at least check your
  store.
\item
  \textbf{Repeat Customers}: Not all, but a percentage of customers, if
  they find value in coming again, they will continue to come to your
  same store. That way the growth continues to be level giving new
  repeat customers the basis to grow.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{return-rate}{%
\section{Return Rate}\label{return-rate}}

\[
\%\ Return\ Rate = \frac{S_g}{S_r}
\]

The return rate is used as a measure of the product that is returned to
the store by the customer in comparision to what has been sold out of
the same store. This metric, as it changes, can indicate a number of
influencing factors such as follows

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Quality of product}: If the product source has changed; or the
  material of the product has changed and has left the customer less
  satisified with the product, generally you will see the return rate
  increase.
\item
  \textbf{shrinkage of product}: As one of the metrics that can be used
  to signal deviant behavior by a single store or a particular
  individual when compared to the rest of the store.
\item
  \textbf{demographic shifts}: Less frequent, but possible it can be
  found that as more individuals move out of an area; there might be a
  change in the philosophy and ethics in returning items to a particular
  store.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{average-transactions}{%
\section{Average Transactions}\label{average-transactions}}

\[
Average\ Transactions = \frac{Units\ Sold}{Transactions}
\]

\hypertarget{weeks-of-supply}{%
\section{Weeks of Supply}\label{weeks-of-supply}}

\[
WOS = \frac{Store\ Inventory}{Week\ Gross\ Sales}
\]

\hypertarget{basket-size}{%
\section{Basket Size}\label{basket-size}}

\[
Basket\ Size = \frac{Gross\ Sales}{Units\ Sold}
\]

\hypertarget{forecasting}{%
\chapter{Forecasting}\label{forecasting}}

Again this could be an entire book just on forecasting

\hypertarget{store-sales}{%
\section{Store Sales}\label{store-sales}}

In order to project the years sales; there are a

\hypertarget{labor-demand}{%
\section{Labor Demand}\label{labor-demand}}

\hypertarget{simulations}{%
\chapter{Simulations}\label{simulations}}

Being able to take the information that we already know and use it to
determine alternative outcomes in an unknown circumstance.

\hypertarget{monte-carlo}{%
\section{Monte Carlo}\label{monte-carlo}}

This recursive algorithm has been around for some time now; but it
continues to be the core of many simulatory methodologies.

\hypertarget{gausian-mixed-models-gmm}{%
\section{Gausian Mixed Models (GMM)}\label{gausian-mixed-models-gmm}}

\hypertarget{profit-loss-statement}{%
\chapter{Profit / Loss Statement}\label{profit-loss-statement}}

From the financial point of view; this is one of the most important
driving mechanisms to be able to manage the expenses of a store. It
gives the decision make the ability to better their overall profit
margins within the stores.

\hypertarget{product-allocation}{%
\chapter{Product Allocation}\label{product-allocation}}

Product allocation essentially tries to fulfill the need of a certain
product in a store. This can be based off a number of different drivers;
however some of the most important are WOS.

\[
WOS = \frac{C_i}{\bar{x}_{ws}}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(C_i\) - Current Inventory
\item
  \(\bar{x}_ws\) - Weekly Sales
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{regression-analysis}{%
\chapter{Regression Analysis}\label{regression-analysis}}

It is important to understand how multiple factors (or variables) relate
to one another within a dataset. Take for example the following
marketing dataset.

\hypertarget{outlier-analysis}{%
\chapter{Outlier Analysis}\label{outlier-analysis}}

Specifically from a Loss Pervention perspective; using different forms
of outlier analysis will help understand deviant behavior and helps
identify.

\hypertarget{bayesian-outlier-analysis}{%
\section{Bayesian Outlier Analysis}\label{bayesian-outlier-analysis}}

\hypertarget{classification}{%
\chapter{Classification}\label{classification}}

There are many uses of classification in the retail space. Some of these
can be difficult to understand as they might have unintended effects
upon each other. The following methods will help identify these issues.

\hypertarget{pricing-optimization}{%
\chapter{Pricing Optimization}\label{pricing-optimization}}

Pricing is important to both the Seller and Buyer; creating a situation
in which you try to find the maximum benefit for both the user and
seller.

\hypertarget{demand-curves}{%
\section{Demand Curves}\label{demand-curves}}

Finding an optimum can be done by running a couple simple AB Tests to be
able to find the Minimum / Maximum optimzation.

\hypertarget{final-words}{%
\chapter{Final Words}\label{final-words}}

Thank you for making it to the end of this book. It has been a fun
adventure trying to come up with a simple but comprehensive analysis of
retail metrics.
