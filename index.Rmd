# Prerequisites

The following book takes into consideration that you have:

* familiarity with R 
* Domain knowledge in retail

However this has been written to be practical; rather than  theoretical so that the practicing novice can pick this up and complete their own analysis of retail data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
